# Reddit "No Participation" (np) Redirect

Description
-
Reddit np Redirect is a web browser userscript extension that redirects reddit "No Participation" (np) links to the regular site.

Purpose
-
This extension was developed because often times reddit links will include an unwanted 'np' subdomain. The np subdomain stands for "No Participation" and it is meant to discourage voting in certain reddit threads. When users attempt to vote in these threads, a popup shows up that informs the user that voting is discouraged. This extension will automatically redirect any 'np' links so the user can vote without being bothered by the popup.

Install & Update
-
This userscript is meant to be used with the extensions Greasemonkey for Mozilla Firefox and Tampermonkey for Google Chrome. It may or may not be compatible with other extensions or web browsers.

1. Install the Greasemonkey or Tampermonkey extension for your web browser.
2. Go to the [raw userscript source](https://github.com/norrism/reddit-np-redirect/raw/master/reddit-np-redirect.user.js) to install or update to the latest version of this userscript.
